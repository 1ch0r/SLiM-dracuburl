# SLiM-dracuburl
Dracuburl is a simple SLiM theme I made for use on my Gentoo machine. It features my personally used background and custom font with dracula themed colors. I recommend pairing your system font with the font used for SLiM though changing fonts for this theme will shift its positioning so customize as needed!
